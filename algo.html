            Binary search is like splitting a phonebook in half to find a name. You start in the middle, check if the name you want is before or after, then repeat the process with the half where it could be. This clever strategy means it takes just a few steps to find something, even in a massive phonebook, making it way faster than checking every name one by one.

            Bellman-Ford is a single-source shortest path algorithm that works for weighted graphs, even those with negative edge weights (unlike Dijkstra's algorithm). It tackles this by iteratively relaxing edges, ensuring no shorter paths are missed.</p>

        <p>The algorithm works in rounds, relaxing each edge in the graph a specific number of times (equal to the number of vertices). In each relaxation step, it checks if a shorter path exists by going through a particular vertex. This process guarantees finding the shortest paths if no negative-weight cycles are present.

    The Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) Algorithm efficiently finds occurrences of a pattern within a text by skipping unnecessary comparisons. It preprocesses the pattern to create a "failure function" that helps in determining where to restart the search upon mismatch. KMP is widely used in text processing tasks like search engines, DNA sequence analysis, and string matching in compilers.

      <p>KMP algorithm builds a prefix table storing the longest proper prefix which is also a suffix for each pattern index. During pattern matching, two pointers traverse the text and pattern. If characters match, both pointers advance; if a mismatch occurs, the pattern pointer is shifted back based on the prefix table. When the pattern pointer reaches the end, a match is found in the text at the corresponding index.</p>

            The algorithm starts by determining the largest element in the input list and then constructs a count array to store the frequency of each unique value. By iterating through the original list, it tallies the occurrences of each element in the count array. Subsequently, a prefix sum operation is applied to the count array to compute the sorted position of each element. In the final step, the algorithm traverses the original list in reverse order, utilizing the counts from the prefix sum to position each element in the output array, while ensuring duplicates are handled appropriately by decrementing the counts.

        <p>Quickselect is an in-place algorithm, meaning it modifies the original list.<br>
          It has an average and worst-case time complexity of O(n), which is significantly better than selection-based algorithms like Selection Sort with O(n^2) complexity.<br>
          The random selection of the pivot element helps achieve the average-case O(n) complexity by avoiding consistently bad pivots that might lead to imbalanced partitions.</p>

  </h1>
  <p class="para">
    Euclid's Algorithm is a method for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers. It works by repeatedly applying the property that the GCD of two numbers is the same as the GCD of the smaller number and the difference between the two numbers. This process continues until one of the numbers becomes zero, at which point the other number is the GCD. Euclid's Algorithm is efficient with a time complexity of O(log min(a, b)).

          <p>
            Euclid's Algorithm has various applications in cryptography, number theory, and other areas of mathematics.<br>
It is used in algorithms like the Extended Euclidean Algorithm for finding the modular inverse of a number.

      <p class="item"><a href="#">Why it Works</a></p>
      <div>
      <p>The key idea is that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. For example, if the GCD of 210 and 45 is 15, then 15 must also divide 210 - 45 (which is 165). By repeatedly replacing the larger number with its difference from the smaller number, we eventually reach a point where the larger number becomes a multiple of the smaller number. The remainder at that point becomes the GCD.</p>
